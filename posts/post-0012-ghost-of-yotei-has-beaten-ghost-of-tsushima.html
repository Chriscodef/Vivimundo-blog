<p>Sony confirmed thatGhost of Yoteihas managed to exceed the sales of its predecessor and helped "significantly" contribute to the company's overall financial results. Sucker Punch'sGhost of Yoteihas enjoyed a lot of success after launching on October 2, 2025. In addition to sterling reviews,Ghost of Yoteiwas nominated for numerous end of year awards, while clearly managing to be a major seller for Sony as well.

Ghost of Yotei creative director Jason Connell revealed one feature that was scaled way back prior to launch, but was ultimately the right decision. Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, recently confirmed that Ghost of Yotei sold 3.3 million units through the first 32 days it went on sale. Better yet, Tao revealed that, "Ghost of Yotei, a tentpole title we released in October, exceeded the sales of the previous title in the same period of time and significantly contributed to the financial results of the quarter." By "same period of time", it's assumed that Tao is referencingGhost of Tsushima's first 32 days of being on sale as well, though the game would eventually hit 5 million copies sold in just under 4 months. What makes this even more impressive is that by the timeGhost of Tsushimalaunched for the PlayStation 4, the console had already been out for 7 years at that point and had a larger base of players than the PlayStation 5 does currently.
