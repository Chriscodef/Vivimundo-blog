The promotional offer matches the game's lowest recorded price on the PlayStation Store and is available toPS5users until late February 2026. Rocksteady Studios' polarizing co-op superhero game has received over a dozen discounts across every major storefront since its early 2024 launch, averaging one price every six weeks. The latest such promotional offer materialized on February 4 as aPlayStation Store exclusive. The latest PlayStation 5 console exclusive is getting rave reviews, continuing a trend that started all the way back in 2017. Thenew PS Store deal offers a 92% discount, reducing the game’s price to $5.59, which is equivalent to $64.40 worth of savings. The promotion matchesSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's lowest recorded priceon Sony's digital marketplace, which the game had only reached twice before: once in late November, and again in the final third of December 2025. The ongoing discount runs most of the month and is scheduled to end on February 26 at 2:59 a.m. ET / 7:59 a.m. GMT. While many of the game's prior sales were multi-platform, the latest offer is limited to the PS Store, with the Xbox and Steam versions remaining at full price. The PS5 promotion technically only applies to the base game, with theDeluxe Edition ofSuicide Squad: Kill the Justice Leaguestill priced at $99.99. Be that as it may, there is a separate discount on the Digital Deluxe Edition Upgrade, bringing its price down to $3.49, or 90% off. For clarity, the digital upgrade can be combined with the base game into the Deluxe Edition equivalent. The upgrade discount runs in parallel with the base game sale, being scheduled to end on February 26.
