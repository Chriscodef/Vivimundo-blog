<p>Minds Eye CEO Allegedly Claims to Have Found Who Supposedly Sabotaged the Game</p>

Now he has allegedly doubled down on these accusations and reportedly identified those involved. According to a new report fromInsider Gaming, which was reportedly sent a video of an internal meeting between Build A Rocket Boy employees and Gerhard, the co-CEO apparently claims to have "caught the guys" responsible for sabotagingMindsEye. The report goes on to say that Gerhard claims it was a "very big Amer</p>
