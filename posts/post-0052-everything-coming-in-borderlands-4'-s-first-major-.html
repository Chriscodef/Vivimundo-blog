<p>Everything Coming in Borderlands 4' s First Major DLC: Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned</p>
<p>Borderlands 4is getting its first major DLC,Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, this March, which will further expand the bombastic looter-shooter. Many players feel that this expansion couldn't come sooner, considering howcontent-leanBorderlands 4's endgameturned out to be.

This fascination with the laws of probability informs the basics ofC4SH's gameplay, which Gearbox describes as being "distinctly unpredictable," his Action Skills always involving the element of chance in some way. At this point, we still have quite a bit to learn about C4SH and how he will function on the battlefield, but his ostensible wild-card archetype certain</p>
