<p>You Have to See This Fallout Vault That a Sims 4 Player Made</p>
<p>Using minimal custom content, aSims 4player has built their own Vault from theFalloutfranchise, inspired by the television show. Despite releasing in September 2014,The Sims 4remains strong, with frequent updates from Electronic Arts, and the latest expansion pack is set to launch on February 12, 2026. Its community, while not always agreeing with EA's direction and pricing for its DLCs, continues to enjoy the game at their own leisure, often recreating locations from their favorite franchises using the game's powerful build mode. For example, players recently recreated theHalliwell Manor fromCharmedinThe Sims 4, as well as the village of Riverwood fromSkyrim. What often makes some of these builds impressive is thatThe Sims 4lots are constrained to a maximum size of 64x64 tiles, forcing players to be creative. This especially shines through in larger projects, such as building a Vault fromFallout. There's always been one Expansion Pack I've wanted for The Sims, but after 20 years, it seemed impossible. Now, my dreams have come true. Made by Rachel Aurore, theSims 4community can now enjoy playing with their Sims in Vault 18, a lot that mainly draws inspiration fromAmazon'sFalloutshow. It features three levels. The bottom level consists of the armory, electrical, and maintenance hall. The middle layer is significantly more complex, featuring five residential units for the vault dwellers, the cafeteria, the clinic, the overseer's office, the classroom, the nursery, a diner, and a storage area. Lastly, the top level features the iconic gardens, a common area, a gymnasium, a laboratory, a party room, a water treatment area, and an experimental room reserved for the overseer. The lot can be downloaded from theSims 4gallery by searching for Vault 18, but players will need to download the custom content used by the lotvia a separate blog. Given the show's popularity and Rachel's impeccable work in recreating aVault fromFallout, it's no wonder that Vault 18 has been met with</p>
