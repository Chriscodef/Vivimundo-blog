<p>Insomniac's upcoming PlayStation exclusive game,Marvel's Wolverine, seems to have narrowed down a potential release date thanks to information found on the Latin American PlayStation Store.Marvel's Wolverinehas already been confirmed for a Fall 2026 release, with Sony sharing this launch window back during the September 2025 State of Play. However, that window may have been narrowed down even further based on new evidence appearing on the PlayStation Store. Marvel's Wolverineis positioned to be one of PlayStation's biggest releases of the year, after Insomniac found success with its previousMarvel's Spider-Mangames. Now, the iconic X-Men mutant Logan is set to star in a visceral action game that boasts battles against foes like Omega Red and Mystique, and locations like the Canadian wilderness and Madripoor. Recent teases also suggestMarvel's Wolverinemay even include appearances fromother Marvel heroes like Daredevil, She-Hulk, and Jean Grey. While Marvel’s Spider-Man 3 hasn’t even been revealed yet, there are some other noteworthy reasons to replay the series this year. According to the listing forMarvel's Wolverinefound on theLatin American PlayStation Store, the game is planned for a Q3 2026 release. This differs from the North American PlayStation Store, which still listsMarvel's Wolverineas coming in Fall 2026. While it might seem like these two release windows are functionally the same, the overlap of the two might narrow down the game's launch date even further. Q3 includes the months of July through September, meaning thatMarvel's Wolverinewill be released in one of those months if the information on the Latin American PlayStation Store is accurate. Considering the announced launch window of Fall 2026, the only month that falls within both Q3 and Fall 2026 is September. As such, it seems likely thatMarvel's Wolverinewill be released in September 2026, assuming the game isn't delayed until 2027. Based on the release dates of Insomniac's previous Marvel games</p>
