<p>The Sims’ Anniversary Nostalgia Comes With a Community Patch Requirement</p>
<p>Ashley has been writing about video games professionally for over eight years, but her path into gaming journalism wasn't exactly a straight line. She grew up playing games and got a Nintendo 64 when she was about 10, immediately falling in love withSuper Mario 64andThe Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time. Over the years, she collected consoles like they were going out of style: Super Nintendo, Xbox 360, and every PlayStation from PS2 through PS5. But honestly? Her gaming interest kind of faded for a while. Then in college, she met a friend who handed herDragon Quest VIIIand said "just try it." That was her first JRPG, and it completely reignited her passion for games. She realized she didn't just want to play them. She wanted to write about them, talk about them, and share that enthusiasm with other people who get it. Since then, Ashley has written forPopCulture.com,ComicBook.com,Business Insider, andTheWrap, covering everything from breaking news to feature stories about how games shape (and are shaped by) pop culture. Her work spans the full spectrum of gaming content: reviews, news coverage, cultural analysis, and the kind of evergreen pieces that help players get the most out of their favorite titles. She has aMaster's in International Media from American Universityand aBachelor's in Mass Communications from VCU, which sounds fancy but really just means she's spent a lot of time thinking critically about how we tell stories, whether that's through traditional media or interactive experiences. At the end of the day, Ashley writes about games because she genuinely loves them. She's not chasing world-first raids or 2,000-hour playtime milestones. She's just someone who's been playing for decades, who understands what makes a game click, and who wants to help other players discover their next favorite experience. For over a decade,The SimsandThe Sims 2existed in the digital purgatory known as abandonware. You couldn't buy them on Origin, you couldn't find them on Stea</p>
