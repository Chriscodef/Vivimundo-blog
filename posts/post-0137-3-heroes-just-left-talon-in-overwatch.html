<p>Overwatchjust introduced a big shakeup to the roster of Talon, with Reaper, Sombra, and Widowmaker leaving the organization just as Emre, Freja, Ashe, and possibly even Junker Queen join. This huge change comes just in time for the relaunch ofOverwatchwith Reign of Talon Season 1: Conquest. Blizzard is literally changing the game when it comes toOverwatchin 2026. The popular hero shooter isdropping the 2 fromOverwatch 2, releasing five new heroes at once, and moving to a storytelling model in which each year focuses on a different plot arc. The first one, called Reign of Talon, started with Vendetta defeating Doomfist and taking over his villainous organization. The soft relaunch of Overwatch starting with Reign of Talon Season 1 sees the removal of a controversial core game mode from map rotation. Now, a new Story Time comic has detailed the aftermath of her ascension. “Vengeance Comes,” narrated by Vendetta voice actor Chiara Preziosi, features the new leader holding a meeting with major Talon figures to organize an attack on Watchpoint: Grand Mesa, a former Overwatch base now controlled by Helix. However, during the debriefing, Moira reveals a shocking twist: Reaper, Sombra, and Widowmaker haveleft Talon in opposition to Vendetta’s hostile takeover inOverwatch. That said, Vendetta is unconcerned with these deserters and is already backfilling her roster with some heavy-hitters to replace these lost agents. Emre and Freja,both former Overwatch search-and-rescue operatives, are working directly with Talon now and will head up the operation for the Grand Mesa mission. Their loyalties to Vendetta do not seem ironclad at the moment, but as long as Maximilien continues paying them well, Talon has acquired some dangerous assets with these two damage heroes. What’s more, Vendetta has secured several external alliances, the first of which is with none other than Ashe’s Deadlock Gang. Her outlaws are set to distract Helix from the Grand Mesa operation, proving Ashe is now</p>
