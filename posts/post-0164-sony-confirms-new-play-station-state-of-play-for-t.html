<p>Sony Confirms New Play Station State of Play for This Week</p>
<p>Following plenty of rumors over the past couple of weeks, Sony has finally confirmed that a newPlayStationState of Play is arriving this week and will focus mainly on news from first party studios. In terms of first-party games, 2026 remains wide open forPlayStationfans, with only games likeSaros,MLB: The Show 26, and evenMarathon, considering Bungie is owned by Sony, being locked in for early 2026 launches. Fans are curious to know what else Sony has coming, especially towards the back half of the year. Rumors of a new PlayStation State of Playhappening in February have been swirling for weeks now. Insider NateTheHate responded to a fan over social media asking if a State of Play could be happening in February, to which Nate confirmed that it would be the case. Unfortunately, no other details were given, leaving fans to speculate as to what kind of show it could be or the games that could be featured. As it turns out, the rumors were, in fact, true after all. Some newly uncovered information on the PlayStation Store may reveal the release date for Marvel's Wolverine, and it's coming sooner than you think. In a newblog post, Sony Interactive Entertainment's Tim Turi confirmed that the next PlayStation State of Play is kicking off in a few days on Thursday, February 12, 2026. Unlike the previous one, aState of Play that focused on Japanese studios, this one is focused on highlighting "eye-catching" third-party and indie titles coming to the PS5, while also giving fans the latest news on what PlayStation Studios teams have been working on. The show will also run for over 60 minutes, so there should be plenty of announcements and news to share. Comments on the social media post seem to have fans excited both about the length of the showcase being over an hour, and the presence of first party announcements. While Sony hasn't teased or confirmed any games that will be there, it's fair to say that they could use the time to highlightMarathonandSarosagain with their releas</p>
