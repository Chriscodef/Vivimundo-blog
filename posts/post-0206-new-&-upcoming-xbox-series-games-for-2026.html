<p>2026's Xbox video game calendaris slowly taking shape, and it will almost certainly be a pretty great year for the console.Microsoft's brand garnered quite a bit of criticism throughout 2025, but the Xbox Series X/S has never stopped receiving fantastic games, even if none of them are exclusive to the system. 2026 will not be an exception, with each month bringing forth dozens of new releases across a spectrum of genres. As keeping up with everything can be tiring, let's simplify the process and go through the big upcoming Xbox games that should define 2026. Hopefully, it will be a memorable year for all the right reasons. New 2026 Xbox Series X games added to the article on February 6:Crisol: Theater of Idols, Clue: Murder By Death, Under The Island, Aerial_Knight's DropShot, KLETKA, Icarus, Towerborne, Scott Pilgrim EX, 1348 Ex Voto, Bubblegum Galaxy, Project Songbird, MLB The Show 26, Gear.Club Unlimited 3, Before I Go, FZ: Formation Z, Relooted, Centipede Gun, Zumba World - The Crazy Marble Dimension, HeadHunters, Borderlands 4 - Bounty Pack 2: Legend of the Stone Demon, Docked, Mirage 7, ChainStaff, Dosa Divas: One Last Meal. On paper, February 2026 is almost frustratingly packed with games. How can we possibly keep up with all the major releases? Xbox Series users won't have to wait long for things to get started, asDragon Quest 7 Reimaginedlaunches on the fifth of the month. Roughly a week later,Romeo Is a Dead Manwill arrive to hopefully satisfy people's cravings for hack and slash goodness, and it will be quickly followed byYakuza Kiwami 3 & Dark Ties,Reanimal, andHigh on Life 2. All these games look fantastic. The second half of the month hasResident Evil Requiem, which is (obviously) February 2026's biggest new Xbox game. It has been years since the last completely new chapter in Capcom's series, and Requiem cannot come soon enough. Another month means a host of new games to play alone or with friends. Here are 10 new games to check out in February 2026!</p>
