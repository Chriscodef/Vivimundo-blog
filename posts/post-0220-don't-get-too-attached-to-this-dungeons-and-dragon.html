<p>Don't Get Too Attached to This Dungeons and Dragons Class After D&D 2024</p>
<p>The Monk inDungeons and Dragonsis one of its first and most iconic classes. Featuring the ability to run up walls or across water, deflect arrows back at their foes, land from immense heights without taking damage, and stun enemies by striking pressure points, the class might as well have stepped straight out of a classic martial arts movie. With a strong East Asian theme, the Monk may have the strongest flavor of anyDungeons and Dragonsclass in history.

DuringSecond Edition AD&D, the Monk was dropped as one of the core classes, though Clerics could take some Monk-like abilities through certain choices. In later supplements, it was reintroduced as a full class, albeit with many of the iconic abilities from the originalAD&Dremoved in favor of some priestly spellcasting.3rd Edition Dungeons and Dragonsbrought back the Monk as a core class, featuring all the familiar bells and whistles, with4th Editionfollowing suit, while also giving them some Psionic</p>
