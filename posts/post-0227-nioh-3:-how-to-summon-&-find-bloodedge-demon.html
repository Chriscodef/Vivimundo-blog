<p>Nioh 3adds a new exploration system to the game that marks all the collectibles on the map as players explore more of that region. This exploration system marks quite a lot of things, but not the boss encounters. One of the secret boss encounters in the game is theBloodedge Demon. Players can summon this boss, but will have to complete a few steps first. The Bloodedge Demon is easily the hardest early game boss in the game, so it is ideal not to face it until the player has fully explored the rest of the map and has enough levels and experience in any fighting style. Here is how summoning this formidable foe inNioh 3actually works. Tired of fighting the Nurikabe walls in Nioh 3? Do not worry, as there is another way of opening these. To summon the Bloodedge Demon, you will first have tofind any Revenant Graveand fight it. After defeating the revenant, it will leave malice that are in the form ofsmall red orbs that fly up in the air. You have to follow the direction these orbs go, and an arrow will also appear on the map. These graves are a great way tofarm Ochoko Cups, which you will need to summon a friendly NPC for challenging boss encounters. Now your task is to keep finding more Revenant Graves in the direction of the arrows. If you go too far out and the arrow points behind you, this means that you have to go to the middle of those. When you reach the area where the Bloodedge Demon is, there will be a lot of Revenant Graves around it and alarge purple gravewhich says, "The malice of all Revenants defeated thus far is gathering." The Bloodedge Demon appears in different places over time, so you will come across these multiple times in the game if you were to try to find it. Being one of the most challenging fights early in the game, the recommended level for this fight is 40+. Even with the high level,there is still one attack that can 100 to 0 you, which is the overhead slash. The boss will lean back and use all of its hands to strike down the weapons it is car</p>
