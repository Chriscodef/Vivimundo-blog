<p>Carla is a writer from Peñuelas, Puerto Rico, now based in Atlanta. She’s an Emory alum with both a BA and MA in English, but more importantly, she’s a Pisces with lots of opinions about video games. Her work has ranged from academic institutions to nonprofits and even Fortune 500 companies, but these days she’s happiest writing about games.

For players, it marks the point where the post-holiday lull fully gives way to the relentless cadence that will define the rest of the year. PlayStation 5 gamers have a lot to look forward to in February 2026, with eight big new game releases on the horizon. The last week of February is coming in hot with plenty of variety for every type of player. Horror fans get to enjoy multipleResident Evilgamesacross platforms, while RPG players get to choose</p>
